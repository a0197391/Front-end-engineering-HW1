    <h1>Story</h1>
     <p>This is the story before being called "Flash" and "Black Swordsman"...
        One day, "Yuki Asuna", a fifteen-year-old girl who was originally unrelated to an online game, wore "NerveGear" due to chance.
        Game master made the following declaration to the players in the game: "Although this maybe a game,but we're not playing around."
        If you die in the game, you will die in reality. All players who heard the declaration were plunged into chaos, and desperate shouts swept the entire game world.
        She didn't even know the rules of this world, so she challenged Aincrad, a floating city of iron and steel that is not topless. As a player, Asuna, in a world that faces a crisis of death at any time, the fate of "Encounter" and "Farewell"──
        Even if played by "The Reality Before Us", Asuna is still fighting desperately, and the lonely swordsman who appears in front of her. Kirito──.</p>
